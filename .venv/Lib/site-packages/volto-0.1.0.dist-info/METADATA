# Volto

**Volto** is a high-performance, flexible ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) library designed to make data processing easier and faster. It is similar to libraries like **Polars** but goes beyond basic functionality, offering more powerful features for modern data engineering tasks.

Volto is still in development, and while it is not yet ready for installation, we are actively working on adding new features and making it production-ready.

## Overview

Volto is built with performance in mind, using the **Rust** programming language to ensure that large-scale data operations run with minimal overhead. The library provides a clean API for data manipulation, allowing users to define ETL pipelines with ease.

Some of the key features we aim to deliver include:

- **High-performance data handling** for large datasets.
- **Flexible transformations** that allow for complex operations on data (e.g., filtering, aggregation, custom functions).
- **Parallel processing** to speed up ETL tasks by leveraging multi-threading.
- **Support for multiple data formats** (e.g., CSV, Parquet, JSON).
- **Advanced data operations** like window functions, joins, and aggregations.

While Volto is still under active development, it aims to be a robust alternative to existing libraries like Polars, providing a wider range of functionalities tailored to ETL workflows.

## Features

- **Fast ETL Pipelines**: Extract, transform, and load large datasets quickly.
- **Parallel and Multi-threaded Execution**: Built-in support for multi-core processing to handle large data volumes efficiently.
- **Advanced Transformations**: Perform aggregations, filters, and custom transformations.
- **Multi-format Support**: Working support for popular data formats like CSV, Parquet, and JSON (additional formats coming soon).
- **Integration with Databases**: Direct support for loading data from and writing to SQL/NoSQL databases (future support).

## Current Status

Volto is a work in progress, and weâ€™re continuously adding new features and improving the performance. While the core of the library is functional, it is not yet ready for full-scale production usage or installation. Stay tuned for future updates!
